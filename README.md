# PlantMatch

Plant Match is a repository with a mission to preserve the folk traditions in the field of ethnobotany.

#Technologies

Full CRUD app with all 7 restful routes.

Bootstrap Framework

#Approach
I started Plant Match with four basic categories that make up the most popular traditions. In order to orient the app appropriately, I made show pages for each category with it's own respective routes.

#Future build
 In order to make the app fully functional, I would need to implement authentication and allow users to login and save/edit their own posts. I would also like to explore the use of tags and a search function that makes navigation easier once the database begins to grow.
